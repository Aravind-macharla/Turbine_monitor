Turbine Efficiency Monitoring and Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project is based on my internship at Kakatiya Thermal Power Plant (1×500 MW), Telangana State Power Generation Corporation Limited (TSGENCO). The work primarily focused on the study of turbines and their auxiliaries, along with efficiency calculations under different load conditions.

The project involves:

Detailed study of High Pressure (HPT), Intermediate Pressure (IPT), and Low Pressure (LPT) turbines.

Performance and efficiency analysis using enthalpy drop calculations, Mollier charts, and steam tables.

Observing real-time plant operations to understand the role of condensers, feedwater heaters, and cooling towers in overall efficiency.

Comparing turbine performance at different load levels (500 MW, 400 MW, 300 MW, 200 MW).

⚙️ Machine Learning Integration

In addition to manual efficiency calculations, I developed a machine learning model to monitor the real-time efficiency of turbines.

Real-time operational data was directly collected from the plant’s computer system.

The dataset included parameters such as steam pressure, temperature, enthalpy values, and turbine output.

The ML model was trained to predict efficiency trends, identify deviations, and support predictive monitoring.

The model runs on the same system where the plant data is logged, providing continuous efficiency monitoring.

This integration demonstrates how data-driven models can complement conventional thermodynamic analysis and improve decision-making in power plants.

📊 Key Results

HPT efficiency: ranged from ~88% at 500 MW to ~60% at 200 MW.

IPT efficiency: consistently high, ~93% across all loads.

LPT efficiency: stable, ~90–91%, even at lower loads.

Machine learning predictions closely matched the manual enthalpy-based efficiency results, while also detecting subtle efficiency variations not visible in traditional calculations.

🛠️ Tech Stack
